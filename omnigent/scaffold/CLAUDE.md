# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (the claude-sdk fkit agents) in this repository. Edit freely.

## Project Overview

_One-paragraph overview of this project — fill in._

The full project brief — domain, architecture, conventions — lives in
[`ai-agents/knowledge-base/PROJECT.md`](ai-agents/knowledge-base/PROJECT.md).

## Knowledge Base & Wiki

A structured wiki lives in `ai-agents/wiki-vault/` (Karpathy LLM-wiki pattern) — synthesized
knowledge not easily derived from the code. Check it before non-trivial work. All wiki reads and
writes go through the **`fkit-wiki` agent** (its `query` / `ingest` / `lint` / `sync` skills) — no
other agent edits the wiki directly.

## Review Notes

Review comments are **inputs to evaluate**, not instructions to apply blindly.

- Treat every review note as potentially fallible — reviewers miss context or reason from outdated assumptions.
- Verify the claim against the actual codebase before changing anything.
- If it is correct, fix the real problem, not the literal wording. If partially correct, address the valid part and explain the rest. If wrong, say so with concrete evidence.
- Do not add speculative fixes just to satisfy a review comment.
