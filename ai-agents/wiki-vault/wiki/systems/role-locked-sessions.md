# Role-Locked Sessions & the Skill Lockdown

**Layer**: shared
**Key files**: `claude/skills-for-role.sh` (`skills_for_role()` — the single source of truth), `claude/fkit-claude.sh` (`build_settings()`), `claude/skill-ownership-hook.sh` (the `PreToolUse` skill-ownership gate), `claude/agents/fkit-*.md`, `.fkit/settings/<role>.json`

## Summary
Every fkit session is pinned to exactly one role. `fkit <role>` launches `claude --agent fkit-<role>` with generated `--settings`, so the session gets that role's system prompt and **only its own `/fkit-*` skills** — every other fkit skill is denied. *(Until 2026-07-18 the lock also carried a per-role **tool allowlist**; ADR-022 relaxed that half — see below.)*

This is what makes *"the coder cannot run the reviewer's procedure"* a **fact rather than a request**. It replaced an earlier model where a single lead session "wore hats" — which was prompt-enforced, and therefore exactly as strong as the model's willingness to comply.

## Architecture

A session is locked **two ways**:

1. **`--agent fkit-<role>`** — the role's system prompt (and, for the adversarial reviewer only, a tool allowlist). Harness-enforced.
2. **`--settings` carrying `skillOverrides`** — `build_settings()` writes `{"skillOverrides":{"<not-owned>":"off",…}}` to `.fkit/settings/<role>.json`. Every `fkit-*` skill the role does not own is hidden from the `/` menu **and unrunnable by name**. Non-fkit skills (the project's own, the user's own) are never touched.

### The scope of the lock — now structural at any depth (2026-07-16)

**There have been two eras.** The distinction matters because two ADRs and much of the older wiki describe the first.

**Era 1 — `skillOverrides`, session-scoped ([[decisions/adr-012-skill-lockdown-is-session-scoped-frontmatter-dropped]]).** The lock was a `skillOverrides` off-list carried by the *launching* session and inherited by every subagent:

```
skill availability = all installed skills − the skillOverrides of the SESSION THAT LAUNCHED THE PROCESS
```

So the lock was **structural in a role session** but **advisory in a spawned consult** — a subagent inherited the *caller's* overrides, not its own, and only the skill's `⛔ Owner:` banner stopped a confused consult from running someone else's procedure. `CONSULT_SKILLS` was a hand-maintained always-on list papering over the gap for the one known case (producer → architect → `fkit-survey-project`).

**Era 2 — the `PreToolUse` hook, structural at any depth ([[decisions/adr-018-pretooluse-skill-ownership-hook-replaces-consult-skills-exception-list]], implemented [[tasks/implement-pretooluse-skill-ownership-hook]]).** The `skillOverrides` off-list and `CONSULT_SKILLS` are **retired**. A `PreToolUse` hook on the `Skill` tool now reads the **real invoking agent's identity** (`agent_type`) from the hook payload — at any spawn depth — and **denies** any skill the caller's role doesn't own per `skills_for_role()`. Enforcement follows the actual caller, top-level session or a consult nested any number of hops.

- **The lock is now structural everywhere it was meant to be.** `fkit coder` cannot run `/fkit-review` in a session, **and a spawned consult cannot run a skill its real role doesn't own either.** The `⛔ Owner:` banner is now a **belt-and-braces backstop, not the sole enforcement** on the consult path.
- **Fail-closed is a hard requirement:** Claude Code hooks fail *open* by default, so any internal hook error must resolve to an explicit deny.
- **Accepted costs (ADR-018):** non-owned skills are now **visible** in the `/` menu though **denied on invocation**; and a **non-fkit subagent** (`general-purpose`, `codex:rescue`, …) carries no `fkit-` identity and is therefore denied **every** `fkit-*` skill, `fkit-query`/`fkit-team` included — the fkit role that spawned it must run the query itself.

> ⚠️ **Older ADR-010/012 language — "advisory in a consult" — is now history, not current truth.** Do **not** re-raise "role separation is only prompt-enforced in a consult" as a defect; that is what ADR-018 closed. A finding must point to a *specific* hook failure (a role reaching a skill it doesn't own, or a fail-open path).

### Consultation — the Agent tool, two hops, no cycles
Cross-role work is a **consult**, never a role switch. `@fkit-<role> <question>` spawns a fresh context that answers and returns; the asker keeps the decision that is theirs. The rules are carried in every agent prompt:

- an invocation from the owner's session is **hop 0**; every consult message states *"you are being consulted at hop N of 2"*;
- **at hop 2 you may not consult anyone** — answer from the code, or return an open question;
- **never consult your invoker**, or anyone already named in the chain (the chain is passed along);
- **genuinely new architecture decisions escalate to the owner** — never settled implicitly between agents.

**This topology is prompt-enforced, knowingly**: Claude Code ignores `Agent(type)` allowlists inside *subagent* definitions, so the hop budget cannot be made structural. *(It used to be structural in one place — `fkit-lead`'s own `Agent(...)` list — until ADR-022 removed the lead's `tools:` line; the topology is now prompt-enforced everywhere, taken knowingly.)*

### The tool half of the lock — relaxed (2026-07-18)

**[[decisions/adr-022-tools-unrestricted-except-adversarial-reviewer]]** (implemented by [[tasks/relax-tool-allowlists-except-adversarial-reviewer]]) relaxed the **tool-allowlist** half of the role lock: the six Claude-side agents carry **no `tools:` line** and inherit every Claude Code tool. Rationale: the capability tools were excluded by accident; the wall was never a real sandbox (every agent holds `Bash`); and only one wall protects a checkable invariant. **The adversarial reviewer keeps `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Skill` byte-identical** — an agent's own `tools:` line governs it at any spawn depth, so its independence survives even when spawned by an unrestricted reviewer. **The skill lockdown (the ADR-018 hook) is deliberately untouched** — capabilities are free, procedures stay role-locked. Related: [[decisions/adr-021-askuserquestion-is-session-only-absent-in-consults]] — `AskUserQuestion` works in a session but is `TOOL_ABSENT` in any spawned consult regardless of the grant (measured, Claude Code 2.1.212), so the consult "return open questions" contract is the only option a consult has.

### What the lock does NOT cover — the task movers (2026-07-18, shipped 2026-07-19)

**[[decisions/adr-025-spawned-agents-may-invoke-the-task-movers]] removed the owner-only gate on `/fkit-task-done` and `/fkit-task-cancelled`**, and [[tasks/implement-spawned-invocation-for-task-movers]] shipped it. Any spawned agent may now move task files, including **the coder closing its own task**.

**The change landed in `skills_for_role()` itself** — the single source of truth this page describes. `claude/skills-for-role.sh` now lists both movers under `lead`, `producer`, `coder`, `architect`, `reviewer` and `wiki`; **`adversarial-reviewer` is the one role without them**, deliberately (findings-only contract, never edits, restricted Codex allowlist per [[decisions/adr-022-tools-unrestricted-except-adversarial-reviewer]]), and `test/skill-ownership-hook.test.js` pins that as a **deny** assertion. ⚠️ **This is worth understanding precisely: the lock did not fail here, it was reconfigured.** The mandatory adversarial pass found ADR-025 unbuildable as written — its Decision 5 forbade touching the hook, but the hook's data source still said `producer` only, so **every non-producer mover call would have been denied before the relaxed prose was read.** The owner ruled to change the mapping. `skill-ownership-hook.sh` itself is unchanged.

Two facts about how this interacts with the lock:

- **The skill gate does not compensate.** The `PreToolUse` hook gates the `Skill` tool by the authenticated caller — it answers *"who is calling"*, never *"is this work complete"*. It will happily allow a mover call from a role that owns the skill.
- **A spawned producer is not a second judgment.** It has **no owner channel** — the `⛔ Owner:` banner is advisory (ADR-012) and `AskUserQuestion` is absent (ADR-021). So *"the coder spawns the producer and asks it to mark done"* is functionally *"the coder marks its own work done, with an extra hop in between."* The spawned role adds a **name**, not a judgment.

The ADR's own honesty clause is the thing to read: **prevention is gone, and the replacement — an `(agent-closed — not owner-verified)` marker — is prose written by the same agent that performs the move, with no code path able to enforce it.** Git does not backstop it either: agents cannot commit, so the commit landing an agent-closed move is authored by the **owner**, and history carries no authenticated trace.

**This is the one place where a universal hard rule was reversed rather than reaffirmed** — contrast [[decisions/adr-023-fkit-git-agent-is-not-built]], which kept commit/push owner-only the same week. The owner's stated distinction is **blast radius**.

## Gotchas / Known Issues
- **There is no `skills:` frontmatter.** It was dropped from all 7 agents: Claude Code treats it as a *preload hint*, not an allowlist, so it enforced nothing. Keeping it — even generated — would have preserved a field that *looks* like the invariant and isn't. **Do not re-add it.**
- **Ownership has exactly one source of truth**: `skills_for_role()` — extracted into `claude/skills-for-role.sh` so both the launcher and the `PreToolUse` hook read it directly (the hook must **not** source `fkit-claude.sh`, whose top-level side effects would fire). Two sources of truth for the flavor's central invariant is one too many.
- **The `PreToolUse` gate is no longer deferred — it is implemented** ([[decisions/adr-018-pretooluse-skill-ownership-hook-replaces-consult-skills-exception-list]]). The old open question — *does the hook payload expose the calling subagent's identity?* — was **answered yes**, verified against the running Claude Code binary (`agent_type`/`agent_id`, at any depth). That is what made the hook available rather than merely priced.
- **`disableAllHooks` is a single point of failure** for the whole gate now that enforcement is entirely hook-based — accepted, because it needs the operator's own settings (the same actor the hook serves).
